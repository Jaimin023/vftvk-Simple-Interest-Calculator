This is a Simple Interest Calculator made by me when was doing an certificate course(Cloud development with JavaScript, HTML and CSS). 
They provided me an templete which had some codes in it. My task was to finish the incomplete code including the logics.
To get that certificate this project was mandatory. 
With the help of this Calculator you can get to how much amount you will recieve at an specific intereest rate when you deposit certain amount of money for few years.
You can enter amount you want to deposit, interest rate and years.
Developing this poject helped me to brush up my skills. I faced some problems while developing it but then after a little struggle i finished the prooject on time.
This project was developed in Vscode.
